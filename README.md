# React CV

This is a form that you fill out, press generate CV, and get a PDF of the CV fully formatted for you.

To-Do:

- Make a better edit function. It's possible to edit now, but it's janky
- Make it look more professional and work on styling
- Add an option to input a picture of yourself in the grey square for your CV
- Have a more dynamic dates system that accepts all types of formats and not just MM-DD-YYYY (just date-fns stuff)
- Have a print button that will automatically pull up a printing prompt for the created CV
- Make the site more responsive so it works on mobile and odd-sized displays
- Have an auto second, third, etc. page maker when overflow happens. This is the only one I have no idea how to do. Currently my best solution is to just make the page go infinitely long, which is kinda lame if you really wanted to submit it as a CV
- Add icons and professional "flare" to the CV

I could do all these, but I feel my time is better spent moving on now that I got a good grasp on the React basics. If I feel I need more React practice later, this is definitely a project I'm likely to go back to.
