# React CV

This is a form that you fill out, press generate CV, and get a PDF of the CV fully formatted for you.

To-Do:

- Make a better edit function. It's possible to edit now, but it's janky.
- Make it look more professional and work on styling.
- Add an option to input a picture of yourself for your CV
- Have a more dynamic dates system that accepts all types of formats and not just MM-DD-YYYY

I could do all these pretty easily but I feel my time is better spent moving on now that I got a good grasp on React.
